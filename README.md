# mail

My implementation of Harvard's CS50 Web. A single-page front-end email client that allows users to send,
recieve, archive and reply to emails.
 
 ## Concepts aqcuired
 * This was a vanilla JavaScript application - no frameworks
 * I was introduced to the concept of asynchronous requests (GET, POST, PUT) via the use of the fetch API.
 * Gained a deeper understanding of DOM elements and ways to manipulate them.
 * Gained a deeper understanding of DOM events and how to utilise them to produce more interactive browser applications.
